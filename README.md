management and reduce stockouts or overstock situations. The task is to develop a machine
learning model that predicts the demand for products based on historical sales data, promotions,
and other relevant factors.

Built a predictive model to forecast the demand for products in the upcoming weeks. And evaluated
the model using appropriate metrics and provide insights into the factors that most influence
product demand.
